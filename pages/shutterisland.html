    <h3><p>Plot Summary</p></h3>
    <p>
        The film is set in 1954 and follows U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels (DiCaprio) and his partner Chuck Aule (Ruffalo) 
        as they arrive at Ashecliffe Hospital, a psychiatric facility on Shutter Island, to investigate the disappearance 
        of a dangerous patient named Rachel Solando. As they dig deeper, they encounter cryptic doctors, uncooperative staff, 
        and unsettling patients, all of whom seem to be hiding something. Teddy soon begins to experience disturbing visions 
        of his past, including memories of his wife Dolores (Williams), who died in a tragic fire.

        As the investigation progresses, Teddy uncovers hints of a sinister conspiracy involving mind control experiments. 
        However, as his paranoia deepens, the line between reality and delusion blurs, leading to a shocking twist that forces 
        both Teddy and the audience to question everything they have seen.
